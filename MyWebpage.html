 <img src="Tim%20(2).jpg" width="200" height="175">
<p>I'm one of those people who has been lucky enough to live all over the United States.This has given me the opportunity to culture myself by meeting, working and living with people from all regions. This has broadened my perspective in all areas of life and I am grateful for that. Graduating the University of Massachusetts, Amherst with a degree in Economics, I entered the proffessional world with no experience and an open mind. Today, I find myself in the same exciting position deciding to leave my career in corporate management to pursue my true passion in Information Technology. Though I'm starting over and reinventing myself, I bring a wealth of experience in both management and proffessional development along with me to wherever I start my IT career.
